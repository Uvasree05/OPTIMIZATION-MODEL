# OPTIMIZATION-MODEL

This project demonstrates how to use linear programming to solve real-world optimization problems using Python and the PuLP library. In this example, we maximize profit from manufacturing tables and chairs under resource constraints like wood and labor availability. The model defines decision variables, objective function, and constraints, then solves the problem to find the optimal production strategy. This approach can be adapted to solve various resource allocation and scheduling problems in operations research and business analytics.
